    <p><strong>Artificial intelligence (AI)</strong> is a set of technologies that enable computers to perform a 
        variety of advanced functions, including the ability to see, understand and translate spoken and written language, analyze data, make recommendations, and more.</strong></em><br>
       <em> AI is the backbone of innovation in modern computing, unlocking value for individuals and businesses. For example, optical character recognition (OCR)
         uses AI to extract text and data from images and documents, turns unstructured content into business-ready 
         structured data, and unlocks valuable insights.  </em>
